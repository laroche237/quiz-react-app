# Quiz App with Timed Navigation

This project is a React-based Quiz Application featuring a timer that navigates directly to the end if users don’t complete all questions in time. Designed for educational and challenge purposes, this app includes multiple questions, organized across multiple pages, with the ability to display several questions per page.


## Features

- Timed Quiz Flow: Each quiz session includes a timer that counts down, moving the user to the end screen if not all questions are completed.
- Multiple Questions Per Page: Supports a layout where multiple questions appear on each page, enabling a more immersive experience.
- Automatic Navigation on Timeout: If the user doesn’t answer all questions within the allocated time, the quiz ends, showing the final results or summary.
- React Component Structure: The app is modular, built using reusable components to manage questions, pages, and the timer seamlessly.
